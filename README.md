# 2DFluidSim

By Shelby Ziccardi & DJ Sekiya

Final Project for our Algorithms and Data Structures class, 
Lewis & Clark College, 
Fall 2017 

A two dimensional particle based fluid simulation with interactive components.

## How to use:

**1. Run FluidSim.java**

This may require using a development environment such as Eclipse to compile.

**2. Interact**

- Click in the box to add particles. You will only be able to add particles near the center of the box. Be careful not to add particles on top of each other.
- Use the '[' and ']' to rotate the box and watch the particles move.

**Known Problems:**
- Particles get stuck in the corners sometimes and sometimes get stuck together. 
- If a lot of particles are stacked up together, the bottom ones will compress.
